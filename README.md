Welcome to my profile,

if you are a recruiter, I think it is worth paying attention to the [Backend for Auto Manager App](https://github.com/MarcinKaminskiPL/auto-manager-back). This is a simple and working REST API implementation in Spring that runs on [Heroku](auto-manager-back.herokuapp.com). You can also run a [simple frontend](http://auto-manager-back.herokuapp.com/) in Thymeleaf.

I also invite you to contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcinkami%C5%84ski/).

Have a good day!
Marcin
